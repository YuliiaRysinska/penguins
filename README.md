The assessment is broken into three overlapping components: a set of tasks, a small project, and a presentational component.
The assessment focuses on the widely available [palmerpenguins data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv
) . 

# Purpose of this assessment:

- Source and investigate sets of data.
- Programmatically explore and visualize data.
- Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets.
- Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.
- Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.
- Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.

# Tasks:
- Create a GitHub repository with a README.md and a .gitignore. Add a Jupyter notebook called penguins.ipynb and add a title to it.
- Find the palmerpenguins data set online and load it into your Jupyter notebook. In your notebook, give an overview of the data set and the variables it contains.
- Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model the variables in the data set in Python, explaining your rationale.
- Create a bar chart of an appropriate variable in the data set. Then create a histogram of an appropriate variable in the data set.

# Project
Select two variables from the data set and provide an analysis of how correlated they are.

# Presentational Component 
Ensure your repository is tidy, with no unnecessary items. Ensure your README.md and .gitignore files are appropriate. Make sure your notebook contains a single cohesive narrative about the data set.
